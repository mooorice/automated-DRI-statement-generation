dri statements
Tiggeri är orsakat av en utbredd fattigdom och diskriminering av minoriteter i vissa EU-länder.
Tiggare är offer för fattigdomen i sina hemländer.
Om vi hjälper de EU-medborgare som är här kommer det snart ännu fler
"Att tillåta gatutiggeri i Sverige, underlättar inte Rumäniens ansträngningar att hjälpa romerna i Rumänien."
Många tiggare är brottsoffer.
EU-migranter kommer till Uppsala pga rykten om mer stöd och natthärbärge. 
Som turistnation får sig Sverige en ordentlig törn när bilden av ett rent och säkert land inte längre visar sig stämma.
Det är inte ok att bryta mot svensk lagstiftning bara för att man är fattig.
Jag känner skuld över att jag själv har det bra när jag ser en tiggare.
Tiggarnas borde inte ta med sina barn till Sverige utan lämna dem hemma så de kan gå i skolan.
Kommunen har ett ansvar att hjälpa de tiggande EU-medborgarna
"Tiggare har samma värde som vi har och därför har vi skyldighet att hjälpa dem med skola, arbete, bostad och mat."
Jag har inget ansvar för att hjälpa de tiggande EU-medborgare som befinner sig i min närhet.
Vi måste försöka hjälpa tiggarna att hitta andra vägar till försörjning.
 Vi måste fokusera på att ge dem bättre hjälp i hemländerna.
Sverige kan inte ta ansvar för alla fattiga människor i världen.
Gatubilden i Uppsala har förändrats till det sämre av att det sitter tiggare här.
EU har ett ansvar att hantera situationen med de tiggande EU-medborgarna som rör sig över gränserna
Tiggande EU-medborgare vill egentligen åka tillbaka till sitt hemland och inte bosätta sig i Sverige
Innan vi hjälper utländska tiggare måste vi ta hand om våra egna svenska uteliggare.
EU är maktlöst mot Rumäniens skamlösa behandling av den romska minoriteten.
Det är vårt samhälle som bjuder in dem att tigga och ta del av vårt sociala skyddsnät.
Det är bra att ge pengar till tiggare
Tiggeri är en organiserad verksamhet med kopplingar till kriminella nätverk och maffia.
Det är för många tiggare på Uppsalas gator.
Våra skattepengar ska gå till svenskar istället för till utländska tiggare
De borde söka arbete istället för att tigga.
Vi får inte hjälpa så mycket att vi sänder fel signaler.
Svenska staten är ansvarig för att hjälpa de tiggande EU-medborgarna i Sverige
Vi har ett ansvar att förbättra tiggarnas situation när de befinner sig i Sverige.
Det finns ingen ytterst ansvarig för tiggande EU-medborgare
 Rumänien tar inte tillräckligt mycket ansvar för romerna.
"Att det växer fram ""parallellsamhällen"" och ""slumområden"" i Uppsala är inte acceptabelt."
Hemländer som t.ex. Rumänien och Ungern har ett ansvar att förbättra situationen för sin minoritetsbefolkning
Tiggande EU-medborgare har det bra i Sverige och vill helst bosätta sig här
Tiggarna försöker lura mig på pengar genom att spela sjuka och fattiga fastän de inte är det.
"Tiggare kommer undan med saker som du och jag inte skulle komma undan med.
"
Vi borde ta in fler flyktingar i Sverige.
Politikerna i Uppsala tar inte sitt ansvar för tiggarna.
Jag känner mig hjälplös när jag ser en tiggare.
Tiggarna urholkar den svenska välfärdsstaten.
Varför tar vi inte hand om rumäner på samma sätt som flyktingar? De är ju i samma situation.
Begging is caused by poverty and discrimination of minority groups in certain EU countries.
Beggars are victims of poverty in their home countries.
If we begin to help those who come here to beg for it will soon be even more.
"Allowing street begging in some EU countries, including Sweden, does not facilitate Romania's efforts to achieve social inclusion and enhancing employability"
Many beggars are victims.
EU migrants coming to Uppsala due to rumors of more support and shelter for the homeless.
Tourism in Sweden is damaged when the image of a clean and safe country no longer proves correct.
It is not OK to break Swedish law just because the offenders are poor.
I feel guilty that I have it good when I see a beggar.
Beggars should not bring their children to Sweden but leave them at home so they can attend school.
The municipality is responsible for helping the begging EU citizens in Sweden.
"Beggars have the same values as us and therefore we have an obligation to help them with school, work, housing and food."
I have no responsibility for helping the begging Roma in Sweden.
We should try the beggars to find other ways to help themselves.
We need to focus on giving them help in their homeland.
Sweden can not take responsibility for all the poor people in the world.
Street scene in Uppsala has changed for the worse since the beggars have come.
The EU is responsible to handle the situation involving EU citizens crossing borders to beg.
Begging EU Citizens really want to go back to their country and not live in Sweden.
"Before we assist foreign beggars, we must take care of our own Swedish homeless."
The EU is powerless against Romania's shameless treatment of the Roma minority.
It is our establishment which invites them to beg and take part of our social safety net.
It's good to give money to the beggars
Begging on the streets of Uppsala is organized with connections to the criminal mafia.
There are too many beggars on the streets of Uppsala.
Our tax money should go to the Swedes not to foreign beggars.
They should look for jobs instead of begging.
We can not help so much that we are sending the wrong signals.
The Swedish state is responsible for helping the begging Roma in Sweden.
We must improve the beggars conditions when they are in Sweden.
There is no ultimate responsibility for begging EU citizens.
 Romania is failing to take responsibility for the Roma population.
"The emergence of ""parallel societies"" and ""slums"" in Uppsala, is not acceptable."
Home countries Romania and Bulgaria have a responsibility to improve the situation of their minority population.
The beggars have it good here in Sweden and would rather live here. 
The beggars trying to cheat me out of money by playing sick and poor even though they are not.
Beggars can get away with things that you and I would not get away with.
We should take in more refugees in Sweden.
Politicians in Uppsala take no responsibility for the beggars.
I feel helpless when I see a beggar.
The migrant beggars are eating way the Swedish welfare state
Why don't we just treat the beggars the same as we do refugees? They are in the same situation.
Laying bitumen on the Bloomfield Track would be beneficial for the environment
I don’t know if improving the Bloomfield Track would lead to a rapid acceleration of development in the area to the detriment of the environment.
In deciding on what to do with the Bloomfield Track I don’t know whether it’s more important to meet the needs of the community or the environment.
"Whilst impacts on locals in the Bloomfield area are a concern, it is the broader community that should carry more weight when deciding what to do with the Bloomfield Track."
I don’t know what the people of Bloomfield think about the Bloomfield Track.
"The road is just the ‘thin edge of the wedge’. This may not happen for a long time, but it will happen."
Erosion from the Bloomfield Track is permanently damaging the coral reefs that fringe the beaches below
"When it comes to the Bloomfield track, people living in Cairns are in no position to judge what the interests of the local residents of Bloomfield are."
If the Bloomfield Track is sealed (bitumenized) there will not be a rapid increase in environmentally damaging development in the Daintree area in the future It may even benefit the environment there.
No development should be permitted in World Heritage areas such as the Daintree.
I would be worse off if more of the Daintree rainforest is protected.
The Bloomfield Track issue is important for Queensland.
"I’m not sure if the future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by locals, outsiders or both."
The fate of the Bloomfield Track is of no concern to me.
Economic development associated with the Bloomfield Track will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
The future of the Bloomfield Track should be determined by everyone and not just by those who live in the Bloomfield area.
"I don’t know how, but I think that there must be some way in which everybody benefits from protecting the rainforest near the Bloomfield Track."
The Bloomfield Track is important because it allows quick access to remote areas of the North.
Conservation in the Daintree area is worthwhile at whatever cost.
Using cars on the Bloomfield Track is bad for the rainforest.
Any decision about the Bloomfield Track will greatly affect people like me.
I have no idea what the people in the Bloomfield area think about the Bloomfield Track.
Erosion from the Bloomfield Track does not cause siltation or damage to the fringing inshore reefs between Cape Tribulation and Cooktown
If we don’t take steps to protect the Daintree Rainforest future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the area as we do now.
We don’t need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Daintree region because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
There is no reason to believe that the Daintree Rainforest is under threat.
"If future generations could have their say about the Bloomfield track, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out."
The protection of plants and animals in the Daintree is OK so long as it doesn’t affect me.
Let’s fix the problems in the Daintree just for now. The future will take care of itself.
The more that it is possible for the average North Queensland resident can access the Bloomfield Track the better
I don’t like how development is creeping further and further North into the Daintree and beyond because of its effect on the environment.
The coral reefs along the foreshore below the Bloomfield Track are not badly affected by the road.
Native animals in the Daintree need protection because they have a right to life which cannot be traded against economic considerations.
The Wujal Wujal Community is better off now that the Bloomfield Track has been built.
The most important use of the Bloomfield Track is for tourism.
I’m concerned that I will be made worse off by any decision about the Bloomfield Track.
"I think that both short and long term perspectives are needed in deciding what should be done with the Bloomfield Track, but I don’t know which one is more important."
"The Bloomfield Track may not have been the best idea, but I guess there is probably little point in closing it now that it has been built."
I don’t really know who benefits most from the protection of Rainforest in the Daintree.
A long term perspective on the Bloomfield Track is essential.
"When it comes to the Bloomfield Track, it’s not important to worry about what the future will hold"
Everyone in Queensland is better off for having a road like the Bloomfield Track.
Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
We are a democratic country.
"The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution."
We live in a great democracy.
Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
"If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered."
In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
"You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around."
I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
"The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views."
"We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me"
"Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy."
Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
I'm always cynical about government processes.
"Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas."
I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
"If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible."
"Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things."
"Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy."
I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
"A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people."
"Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction."
Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
People get the government they deserve
There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
"Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic."
"The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless."
The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile. 
"It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time."
In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
"We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years. "
"The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party. "
Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views. 
"We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition. "
We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government. 
There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
"Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote."
"Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do."
Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
We should be concerned about the impacts on tourism if increasing extreme weather events deter people from holidaying here.
We should be worried about predicted increases in housing insecurity.
Protecting the natural environment is a relatively unimportant concern compared to other climate change threats.
"We shouldn't interfere with development in the city, to deal with effects from climate change. "
I'm NOT concerned about the psychological impacts of climate change. 
Making sure that everyone has easy access to food is not one of the most important issues compared to other impacts from climate change.
The community should be involved in discussions about climate adaptation.
I am concerned about people losing their houses because of coastal erosion.
We should focus on protecting human systems rather than environmental ecosystems.
Australia's major industries should be protected from climate impacts. 
We need to make sure we have a good local response for disasters to deal with extreme weather such as storms and bushfires. 
Planning for climate adaptation should take into account Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural sites to preserve their heritage. 
We need funding to boost our emergency response for events such as flooding and bushfire.
"Some communities will be more affected than others by climate change, but this is not a priority issue. "
We should work towards a new type of economy that does not pollute the environment.
The negative effects of climate change on local commerce should be taken into account.
It is important to implement policies within Council operations that conserve water. 
"For local governments, liability issues and avoiding litigation for negligence are key when prioritising adaptation actions."
The climate threat to the Great Barrier Reef is too far away from local issues to be of concern.
It is NOT necessary to engage with the community when deciding what are the most important issues for planning for climate adaptation.
"Planning for climate adaptation needs a holistic approach, considering a whole range of issues, instead of focussing on individual issues. "
Infrastructure needs to be improved as it can’t cope with the changes that we’re experiencing. 
It is important to plan for migration by people displaced by climate impacts.
Australian farmers are one of the most important groups in our society that need help to adapt to climate change.
Councils have all the resources they need to adapt effectively to climate change.
We need to deal with the urban heat island effect through measures such as planting trees.
Health services need to prepare for the physical impacts of climate change on health (such as heat stroke) and the impacts on mental health (such as farmers who lose their crops). 
We need to focus on adaptation actions that are concerned with the economic future of the country.
Infrastructure development should be reviewed to be sure it is adequate for environmental changes.
"When adapting, we should focus on basic needs like housing, water and food."
We need adaptation measures to deal with interruptions to the power supply during heatwaves.
"The main focus of planning for climate adaptation should be to prepare for extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding. "
Increased costs for insurance are a serious concern in respect to climate change. 
We should protect our unique natural environment and ensure that species  found nowhere else on earth will have a future. 
We should protect energy production and provision.
I'm concerned about increased storm surges and their threat to human life and property.
There is no urgent need to prepare for an increase in illness and death caused by high temperatures. 
"It is important to support vulnerable groups (elderly, children, disabled, homeless, low-income) as they have the fewest resources to deal with impacts of climate change. "
The City should plan for any deep structural change necessary to protect all infrastructure and operations of the City.
The City should implement education programs and assistance for individual households and businesses to develop their own plans to accommodate and adapt to climate change.
"The City should make plans to withdraw from vulnerable areas, and relocate or abandon threatened infrastructure."
Adaptation should be focussed on ensuring continued economic growth of the City of Sydney.
More research and development is needed to inform an appropriate adaptation policy.
Adaptation really needs to be coordinated at the State level (rather than the local council level) in order to be effective.
The City doesn’t need to take any action on climate adaptation.
Environmental organizations have moved the management of our forests to where it is being done by emotion and not by science.
Returning forests to presettlement conditions ignores the need for wildlife that are adapted to current forest conditions by mandating drastic thinning virtually overnight. 
We need to allow forest managers to determine how to improve forest health to minimize fire damage and loss.
We have to move forward with large-scale restoration-based fuel reduction and learn as we go.
Stakeholders in forest management should work together to define management objectives more by experiments and adaptive management. 
"Science is the most important component informing all management decisions — more so than social, cultural and economic considerations."
Old Growth protection is necessary in order to preserve and protect the viability of species dependent upon Old Growth ecosystems.
The government is advancing timber sales in the name of ecological restoration.
"To make thinning projects cost effective, private logging companies must be able to log larger trees."
Using citizen participation in forest management is very important for basing decisions on different ideas and cultural values along with science. 
Aggressive fire suppression has caused the majority of the problems regarding  fires. 
Natural resources must be developed for the benefit of the plain American citizen.
Forest lands should be brought back to their state before human intervention began.
"Without public participation there will be conflict, whereas participation leads to cooperation."
Forest restoration projects should be done in all areas of the forest including roadless and wilderness areas.
Needless red tape and lawsuits delay effective implementation of forest health projects on public lands.
Large trees must be removed in order to create openings for wildlife habitat. 
"Traditional, sustainable forestry that benefits local economies and maintains rural livelihoods is much better than large scale corporate forestry."
"We need active forest management on our public lands, through thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the unnatural buildup of fuels."
We should not manipulate nature by restoring forest conditions.
All fuels treatment projects on public lands should comply with existing environmental laws even if compliance slows implementation.
Federal forest management policy should make it easier for loggers to thin out backcountry forests by easing regulatory restrictions and making it harder for interest groups to stop or delay that work.
Humans are a part of the environment. We need to learn how to live sustainably with that environment as much as possible. 
We need to experiment with a range of treatments that could meet restoration goals. 
"Prescribed burns are a flawed idea, especially when there are other practices available for restoration."
"Forests must contribute to the economic stability of forest-dependent communities.  There are many job opportunities and value-added products that come out of the forest such as wood for art, vigas for building homes, wildlife for food, herbs for medicine, and grass for livestock."
Forest health needs restoring after decades of government mismanagement.
A diameter cap should be placed on all thinning projects to ensure large trees are not cut.
Thinning efforts should focus entirely on the small trees that make up the vast majority of the fire risk in the forest. 
Fire is a natural and vital component of most western forest ecosystems.
Prescribed burning is needed to restore fire-adapted ecosystems.
"If an action is determined to be necessary to control a wildfire, save lives and/or property, and ensure that fire crews can do their jobs safely and efficiently, then it is appropriate to act even if it results in the take of an endangered species."
"Small scale thinning projects should give the communities involved pride in taking part in a sustainable forest management plan, and it also allows the traditional communities to realize a boost to their fragile economies."
The main issue in forest management is to protect loss of life and property due to catastrophic wildfire. 
"We need to be cautious: the solution is there, but we still have a lot to learn. If we just jump in, we’re going to make mistakes."
"People should take what is needed from forests, but in a context of stewardship and sustainable use and interaction with nature. "
"Federal agencies need to restore public trust through transparency in project intent, development and implementation."
Forest management involves restoring ecosystem function and processes that maintain ecosystems over the long run. 
Demonizing fire is a mistake: we must accept risks of fire damage to property and implement controlled burning.
We need to clean up the bureaucratic maze that stops our professional foresters from being able to do the work that they are trained to do.
"Fire risk reduction projects should clearly focus on the wildland-urban interface, avoiding treatments in roadless areas."
Land managers should return public forest land to natural conditions and fire cycles that are specific to each forest-type.
Federal land management procedures are so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological crises on public lands.
The increased density of forests in the West has not damaged ecosystems.
Forest health means jobs.
"Public funds should pay for biobanks, instead of private companies.  "
The community that donates samples for research should receive improved medical services.  
All participants should be paid for donating their samples to a biobank. 
Genetic information is different from health information. 
The confidentiality of personal medical information is critical in any circumstance where research is being conducted.
High-priced genetic research is diverting funds that could be used to promote public health.
Race is a useful topic for genetic studies.
Sampling some people in an ethnocultural community is acceptable only if the whole ethnocultural community has agreed to participate.
"To me, religious communities need to be consulted about genetic and biobank research. "
Genetic studies of disability will lead to the discrimination of people living with the same conditions.
Genetic studies of race on enthocultural communities will lead to the discrimination of those same enthocultural communities. 
The priority for healthcare should be to reduce inequalities and the burden of disease.
Biobanks are useful even if they only produce more scientific knowledge and not medical advancements.
It is always permissible to do research on my personally identifiable sample without my prior permission.  
There is no point in consulting the public about ethical issues in science and technology.
Genetic research will improve our lives.
Deciding how to regulate biobanks should be left to the government. 
There is no risk to the participants who donate to biobanks.
Policy makers should consider the possibility that Canada should not pursue biobanking.
My personal sample should never be anonymized since I should be informed of important research results.  
Researchers should be allowed to use samples for research but they should not own them.  
Participants should be contacted every time researchers want to use their samples for research.
Aboriginal communities require special consideration concerning healthcare and research.
Educating people about health issues (e.g. diet and lifestyle changes) promises greater health effects than investing in biobanks.
"If someone is a carrier of a genetic disease, they have a responsibility to participate in genetic research."
Participants should always be able to withdraw their sample from research at anytime. 
I should have property rights to my tissues before or after they leave my body.
Participants who donate their samples for research should be given special access to the treatments and therapies that result from that research. 
Permission from the indigenous community must be sought if samples are collected from indigenous peoples.
Participants should be active in the set up and oversight of  biobanks. 
Biobanks will only lead to expensive treatments and high profits. 
"Scientists should have access to all unidentified, personal samples for research."
Biobanks need independent review boards to determine who should have access to samples. 
I trust researchers to control access to my personal samples.
Everyone should donate samples to a biobank for the benefit of everyone. 
I do not care if my donated sample is connected to my name and medical information.
The fact that we cannot predict what biobanks will be used for bothers me. 
Profits from biobanking should be returned to the donating community. 
Replacing timber elements with steel components would destroy the authentic appearance of the bridge.
Alterations will lead to nothing but the uglification of the bridge.
The bridge has stood the test of time for the past 67 years; there’s no need for major changes to it.
The safety of the bridge is more important than its appearance.
The main concern is to have a bridge that underpins the economic activities in the region.
The function of the Fremantle Bridge as a transport gateway is more important than its heritage.
There are no specific economic benefits for the Fremantle from the bridge.
"The problem is not the vulnerable structure of the bridge but excessive traffic, which should be reduced."
"As long as there is a bridge that I can cross, I don’t care about its structure."
"We should definitely preserve the heritage value of the bridge, but only if it is financially viable."
Tax payers money should be spent on services that are more essential than upgrading the bridge.
It is worth spending money to retain the iconic status of the bridge.
"We shouldn’t stick to the past when deciding about the future of the bridge, we should be open for modern design options."
The bridge is certainly an attractive entry statement to Fremantle and without doubt far more important than trucks.
"The Fremantle Bridge is irreplaceable. It is a strong, enduring part of our history."
Reducing the risk of vessel collision on the Swan River should be the main consideration when deciding about the future of the bridge
It is most important that the solution is a long term one.
River craft deserve better traffic conditions on the Swan River.
Altering or replacing the existing Fremantle Bridge means diminishing Fremantle.
"Whatever works are undertaken, the heritage value of the old bridge will be affected."
The old bridge provides a scenic entrance to Fremantle that attracts tourists.
The cost of maintaining the old timber structure is too high.
Providing a better pedestrian and cycle traffic should be the main consideration when deciding about the future of the bridge.
"The old bridge will never be able to handle vehicles, bike and pedestrians at the same time."
The most important thing is that access to Fremantle from its north is maintained in the most undisturbed manner as possible. 
"The most important issue for cyclists is safety, which means they need access across the bridge which has a good surface."
"Since the traffic bridge has important heritage significance, the only grounds for its removal should be on the grounds of serious safety issues and verified by heritage engineers."
The existing bridge is too low; archways too narrow and do not line up with the railway bridge making navigation dangerous. 
The critical infrastructure of the bridge raises serious safety concerns. 
Safe and efficient movement of all road and river users across and under the bridge should the main considerations
Any changes to the bridge should give right consideration to the environment.bridge
"We just got traffic calming in Town Centre after 25 years effort. I don’t want bridge to be build bigger, better faster to reverse the gains of the last 25 years."
"This magnificent timber bridge is a rare and beautiful sight in today’s world, it should be preserved. "
"When deciding about the future of the bridge, indigenous concerns should be given adequate consideration. "
The Fremantle Traffic Bridge is the most iconic landmark and the main tourist attraction in Fremantle. 
"Indigenous people would want to minimize impact on the Swan River, a registered site, that is of importance and significance to them."
There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
"Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?"
More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
I don’t trust what scientists say about climate change.
I don’t trust what I hear about climate change from government.
We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
I’m not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
There’s not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
It’s difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
"It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect."
"I’m not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action."
It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
We can adapt to the coming changes.
It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
I care about the planet.
"I don’t know what to do. I’m very concerned and would like to do something, but I don’t have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference."
Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won’t make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
"I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless."
"Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution."
We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
"I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard."
"When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing."
Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I’m doing the most I can.
The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
"Australia's emissions are tiny, so it’s not up to us to act."
Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
Reducing greenhouse gases should not mean prices have to go up.
"Can we be confident, that if we store CO2 the storage facility is going to hold it forever? That's really the issue. And I don't think anybody can answer that question."
Our present energy system is so cheap precisely because it is unsustainable.
Many big ticket solutions to energy problems that we don’t understand are just too risky.
Combining technologies in the energy sector is a much more promising and more productive approach than relying on a single approach. 
Energy technologies such as nuclear power and geosequestration are too risky. It’s better to improve the technologies that we already have.
Governments must fund new infrastructure investment in the face of uncertainty in the economics of energy technologies.
"Energy technologies are pretty complex, so I leave it to the experts. "
"Wind power has its downsides — it is highly visible and can kill birds. The fact is though, that any man-made structure can kill birds.	"
Coal gasification is needed to produce hydrogen on the scale required for a possible transition to a hydrogen-based economy.
Australia should  turn more attention to biomass energy sources because it is CO2 neutral (the carbon dioxide used by the growing plants is released when they are burned).
Any tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a detrimental economic effect on the nation.
There is no need make expensive investments in technological changes within the energy sector.
"If the cost of greenhouse gas emissions is factored in, the cost of renewables compared to coal isn't so big."
Reducing our reliance on oil would be good for the economy and the environment.
"Solar power is pointless because it can't guarantee constant supply, for obvious reasons: the sun doesn't always shine."
"Nuclear has a few dangers, but they're trivial compared with the dangers of emitting greenhouse gases and letting global warming happen."
Fuzzy-headed thinking about alternative energy sources seems not to appreciate the need for certainty of supply and excess capacity to keep economies growing.
Nuclear power is a more proven technology than it was 30 years ago. In reality atomic power generation can be a very safe system if designed and operated correctly.
"It is very hard to trust all these so-called experts arguing for one energy technology or another, especially when they, or their bosses, are just in it to make money."
Rather than look at costly renewable energy a more fair-dinkum strategy would be to encourage technology that captures greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide.
" If Australia mines uranium, the country should be able to generate power from it."
"Local energy solutions such as windfarms are good for jobs, local economies and tourism."
Energy is going to get costly so we had better start investing in alternatives.
"Australia doesn't support alternative energy opportunities. Industry comes along and says, 'Have I got something for you' (such as carbon sequestration, or a new power station) and they get government subsidies to do it."
"I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm not pro-coal, I'm not pro-wind, I'm not pro any kind of generation. I'm pro-energy conservation through changes to our behavioural and design practices."
"Environmental, reliability and cost issues will limit the adoption of large-scale  of certain renewable technologies. "
Australia spends too much on research and development in energy technologies.
Nuclear is the inevitable replacement for old hydrocarbon technology. It is cost-competitive with coal and will cogenerate potable water and hydrogen also at societally acceptable costs.
"You could have a wind farm across all of the outback that would kill every kookaburra, but it wouldn't provide the baseload power we need."
Climate change considerations have no role in the development of national and global energy policies.
Prices of alternative energy will fall as technology improves.
The limited strategic and technical insight that is so entrenched in Australia is limiting the development of innovative energy technologies.
"Any return on geosequestration is 15 to 20 years off, whereas the proven technology of renewable energy offers immediate gains."
"The petroleum age is far from over, we will still be able to keep finding more oil."
"The urgency of addressing greenhouse emissions cannot stay on back burner for too much longer. So we need to find a solution quickly, such as CO2 capture and storage."
We need coal because it is a cheap and reliable energy source.
Geothermal or hot rock technology will provide a reliable and unlimited and cheap energy source.
I don’t want the implementation of new energy technologies to disrupt my way of life.
Natural gas is the bridging fuel between the oil economy and the hydrogen economy.
Renewable sources do not have the potential to meet our future energy needs as they stand.
"Renewables are part of the long-term solution, but for the foreseeable future, they just can't do the job."
"Apart from coal, natural gas is the only other potentially reliable source of power for the state."
Using biomass from crops has significant expansion potential and would be good for the rural industry.
Coal-powered energy needs to be minimised because of its high greenhouse gas emissions.
"Il passaggio dall'unione alla fusione è un balzo troppo grande che comporta troppe incertezze. Quando le cose sono fatte in maniera più graduale, il passaggio sarà indolore perché la gente si sarà abituata."
La fusione è un piccolo passo per completare un percorso iniziato venti anni fa con l'unione dei comuni. Il comune unico di fatto esiste già. Quanto ancora dobbiamo aspettare?
La fusione cancellerà le diversità locali.
"Il comune unico non è l’unica soluzione ai problemi del nostro territorio, ma è la soluzione più importante e concreta che in questo momento si possa proporre."
Non è stato ancora chiarito come faranno ad amalgamare i contratti dei lavoratori dipendenti comunali su tutto il territorio. Cose come queste dovrebbero essere decise prima della fusione e dovrebbero essere fatte consultando le parti. 
"La fusione è una decisione che è già stata presa e che ci vogliono imporre dall'alto. Stanno cercando di venderci il prodotto ""comune unico"""
"Con o senza comune unico, l'importante è che non cambi nulla a livello pratico, per esempio dove staranno gli sportelli dei servzi."
Con la fusione gli impiegati potranno aumentare le loro competenze tramite delle specializzazioni e i cittadini avranno migliori servizi.
"Si sta facendo un uso distorto della fusione, senza rispettare le esigenze del territorio, impiegando l'intera Valsamoggia solo come una cavia da laboratorio."
Non vorrei che i soldi delle mie tasse andassero spesi a beneficio dei comuni vicini
La fusione permetterà di derogare il patto di stabilità e di sbloccare i fondi di alcuni comuni che potranno essere reinvestiti a beneficio dei comuni più bisognosi
La fusione mi sembra il solito modo per cambiare tutto senza cambiare nulla
La fusione è un salto nel buio
"La fusione è necessaria per un abbassamento della tassazione di cui gioveranno tutti, dalle industrie ai cittadini"
Non ci sono abbastanza elementi per decidere in favore o contro la fusione.
La fusione è un processo innovativo. Saremo un esempio per il resto d'Italia e d'Europa.
La fusione è la risposta giusta ai limiti dell' Unione dei comuni.
La fusione offre la possibilità di risparmiare risorse tagliando i costi della politica e della burocrazia e aumentando l'efficienza dell'amministrazione.
La scelta della fusione è dettata dalla volontà di mantenere l'egemonia politica di alcuni partiti sul terriotrio.
"La fusione permetterá di avere le risorse necessarie per fare gli interventi che tutto il nostro terriotorio necessita, come migliorare la viabilità collegando le piste ciclabili o il servizio trasporti tra i comuni o la scuola superiore."
Senza la fusione i singoli comuni non potranno mantenere l'attuale qualità dei servizi. 
"Tramite la fusione potremo sfruttare le potenzialità del territorio, per migliorare lo sviluppo edilizio, commerciale, artigianale e dell'agricoltura."
"Un comune così grande ha più peso politico di fronte agli interlocutori esterni, come per la Bologna metropolitana. In questo modo si potranno tutelare meglio i nostri interessi dall'esterno."
"In seguito alla fusione, o pageremo più  di prima o taglieranno i servizi."
"Non e' possibile dire un si o un no alla fusione senza
sapere come sarà il nuovo comune, quanto costerà,
come sarà fatto l’adeguamento delle tariffe e dei servizi."
"La fusione cambia il nostro modo di relazionarci all'amministrazione locale, allontanando l'amministrazione dal terriotrio locale e accentrando il potere da qualche altra parte."
"La fusione va a scapito dei comuni più  piccoli e a vantaggio di quelli più  grandi, anche dal punto di vista dei finanziamenti esterni"
La fusione è troppo rischiosa perché è un processo irreversibile
Le esigenze e le abitudini dei cittadini sono troppo diverse nei cinquei comuni. Sarà troppo difficile per il comune unico di soddisfarle tutte.
Se le amministrazioni hanno scelto di procedere per la fusione significa che è la scelta giusta. Questa decisione spetta agli amministratori più che ai cittadini.
"In questo tempo di crisi e cambiamenti su scala Europea, la fusione e' necessaria e opportuna."
"L'unione è stata un fallimento e un costo, assorbendo in tutti questi
anni la gestione solo di una minima parte dei servizi e del bilancio"
Non vale la pena fare la fusione in questo clima di riorganizzazione generale con la città metropolitana.
"Non è necessario essere un comune grande per essere
virtuosi. I comuni piccoli possono essere gestiti meglio di quelli grandi e fare più cose. E' una questione di buona amministrazione.
"
"In questa fusione manca un progetto, una visione e una strategia. Le cose dovrebbero essere fatte in maniera molto diversa"
"Con la fusione si verrà a creare un deficit democratico, perché i Consigli di Municipio saranno solo consultivi. I cittadini non avranno piu voce in capitolo."
the shift from the union to the fusion is a step to big which brings too many uncertainties. If things are done more gradually the change will be hurtless because people will be already used to it.
the fusion is a samll step to complete a path of amalgamation that started 20 years ago. The amalgamated municipality it is a realty in facts. How much do we have to wait still?
the amalgamation will erease the local diversities
the fusion is not the only solution to the issues of our territory but it is the more concrete
it is not yet clear how are they are going to amalgamate the contracts of the municipal clerks across the territory. things like these should be decided before the amalgamtion.
"the fusion is a decision that has already been taken and they are trying to imposing it top down. They are trying to sell the product ""amalgamated municipality"""
"with or without the amalgamation, the important thing that is at the practical level, nothing will change. For example the offices should stay where they are."
the amalgamation will benefit the emplyees and the citizens. The emplyees will increase their competences through more trainings. Therefore the citizens will benefit of more specialized professionals.
we are misusing the fusion. The needs of the territory are not being respected and the valsmaoggia is being used as a labrat
I would not like that the money of my taxes would be used in the municiplities next to mine
through the fusion we will be able to derogare il patto di stabilita' and therefore unblock some founds. The latter can be invested in the municipalities that are more in need 
the fusion seem to me another way to change everything to change nothing
the fusion is a leap in the unknown
the fusion is necessary to lower the taxes
there are not enoughf elements do decide in favor or against the fusion
the fusion is an innovative process that will make as an example to follow for italy and the rest of europe.
the fusion is the right answer to the limit of the union
the amalgsmation will offer the possibility of save money by cutting the political costs and the burocracy costs and making the administration more efficient.
the choice of the fusion is due to the wish of certain political parties to maintain the political dominance
"the fusion will bring the resources to make the intervention that our territory needs, like the bycicle paths or the public transport between the municipalities or the high school."
"if the fusion will not be done, the single municipalities will not be capable of maintaining the current quality of the services."
"through the fusion we will be able to exploit the potentials of the territory to improve the building-, commercial- handcraft- and agricoltural development."
the new municipality will be politically more powerful in front of other municipalities like Bologna metropolitan. In this way our interests will be protected outside our municiplity.
the consequence of the fusion is that either we will pay more than before or they will cut the services
"it is not possible to say yes or not to the amalgamation without knowing how it will be, how much will it cost and how it will be done."
the fusion will change our relationship with the administration. The fusionwill move away the administration and the power from the local territory and centralizing it somwhere else
the fusion benefits the bigger mnicipalities at the detriment of the smalles also with respect to the external fundings.
the fusion is too risky because is a oneway process
the needs of the citizens are too different acros the municipalities. It will be too difficult for The amalgameted municipality to answer to everybody.
if the administration chose for the fusion it means that it is the right choice. This choice should be taken by the experts not the citizens
"in this days of crisis and changes at the european level, the amalgamation is necessary and opportune."
"the union is a failure and a cost, because it absorbed just a very small part of the services and the money"
it is not worth to make the amalgamation in this time of reorganization with the metropolitan bologna
it is not necessary to be big to be good. The small municipalities can be better managed of the bigger and do more things. It is a matter of good administration.
"in this fusion there is no project, no vision and nos trategy. Things should be done in a very different way."
with the amalgamation there will be a deficit of democracy because the municipalities will be only consultive. The citizens will have no power
Short term development thinking will ultimately lead to longer term reef damage and economic impacts.
Economic development associated with mining will provide more opportunities for future generations in North Queensland.
Protection of the Great Barrier Reef is worthwhile at whatever cost.
If we don’t take steps to protect the Great Barrier Reef future generations will miss out on the opportunity to experience the reef.
We don’t need to worry too much about environmental damage in the Great Barrier Reef because future generations will be better able to deal with these problems than we are.
"If future generations could have their say about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be less concerned about the environmental impacts than many people make out."
Townsville is better off because of mining development.
"We should prioritise protecting the environment in Townsville, even if it hurts our economy."
Jobs and growth in Townsville should be prioritised over Great Barrier Reef protection.
Government should be doing more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Mining development in Australia is a risk to the environment.
I think enough is being done to effectively manage the Great Barrier Reef.
Climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef aren't something I'm worried about.
"Climate change is a threat, but the impacts are too distant for immediate concern."
"Each new Australian coal mine will contribute greenhouse emissions that exacerbate the risk of climate change, and impacts to the Reef."
There is no point throwing money at protecting the reef if our other actions contribute to its continuing decline.
The Great Barrier Reef underpins more direct and indirect jobs than mining does. 
The negative publicity about climate change impacts on the reef has negatively affected the local tourism industry.
A few self-interested politicians and influential companies are prepared to sacrifice our well-being for their own short-term gain.
"Government should provide funding support for industry, including mining projects such as the Adani mine."
"Coal-generated electricity must be phased out if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts of global warming, including the loss of the Great Barrier Reef."
The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset for the economy of this region and we should prioritise protecting it.
Climate change is an immediate threat requiring action.
I feel that future generations have been adequately considered in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.
The mining industry provides thousands of jobs. Without it unemployment would have skyrocketed in regional Queensland.
There are more jobs to lose from Great Barrier Reef tourism than to be gained from the coal industry.
Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is so small that we should wait for other countries to take action on climate change before we do. 
"If we are serious about maintaining and improving people's living standards in Townsville, we need to make the most out of coal exports."
We should prioritise economic development and job creation in Townsville over the environment. 
It is not possible to conserve the reef over the long term without addressing climate change 
"While job creation is important, we should prioritise industries that have less impact on the reef over those that have greater impact on the reef. "
The first priority should be reducing other pressures on the reef (such as agricultural runoff or coastal development) so that the reef will be more resilient to climate change impacts. 
More scientific research is needed before we can say if climate change is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
Deep-pocketed green groups are willing to sacrifice our local economy for their own goals. 
There is no strong scientific evidence to suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from climate change.
It's a slippery slope from genome editing for medical reasons to using it for other reasons.
Parents and guardians have a right to edit the genes of their children before they are born.
Parents who want genome edited 'designer babies' with certain traits are selfish.
Strong genes have the greatest effect on a person’s wellbeing.
I'm concerned that genome editing will lead to a reduction in genetic diversity.
I think it would be amazing to have a choice in the way someone behaves.
The idea that gene editing can make perfect people and societies is extremely dangerous.
I think it's okay to use genome editing to change someone's appearance.
I'm concerned that gene editing will be used as a quick techno-fix without actually dealing with real problems.
"My concern is that as we start to tinker with the genome, we're going to accidentally introduce a whole host of other problems."
"If this technology is available then it should be available to everyone who needs it, not just those who can afford it."
I'm worried that genetic technology will widen the gap between those who can afford it and those who can't
If we open the box of genome editing we will not know where to draw the line.
I am concerned that the use of human genome editing will advantage one group over another.
Decisions about the use of genome editing are best left to the experts.
"If genome editing works, the future will be like a dystopian movie."
Genome editing is really cool science.
The real aim of genome editing will be enhancement for wealthy people.
I have a very different feeling about gene editing in humans than I do for animals or plants
Editing genes that will be inherited is problematic because it means making decisions for future people who don't exist yet. 
My cultural beliefs make me cautious about genome editing.
When you change someone’s genes you are fundamentally changing who they are.
Genome editing in agriculture will have the biggest impact on people's health. 
Anything that's been artificially created in a lab  gives me Frankenstein vibes.
Mitochondrial donation doesn’t fundamentally change our genetics should be viewed like any other organ transplant.
I worry that something will go terribly wrong with this technology.
It’s better to prevent a disease from happening rather than it happening and then having to treat it.
The idea that people with genetic conditions might get cured in my lifetime is miraculous and incredible!
Genome editing techologies gives us power over human life itself. 
It makes me sick to hear that genome editing will 'cure' disability.
I would be OK with using genome editing to speed up evolution.
"As a society, we have an obligation to help strengthen coming generations by eradicating diseases. "
We find strength when we face illness and adversity. It makes us who we are.
"If genome editing is proven to be safe, then I see no reason to oppose it."
It is better to accept our genes the way they are than to tamper with things we don’t understand.
I would strongly consider using genome editing for my children if it could safely give them an advantage in life. 
I don't think we know enough about genetic diseases or the long term consequences of genome editing
I think we should keep an open mind about new discoveries.
I would be OK with having my own genome edited.
Each individual has a right to decide for themselves whether to undergo gene editing.
Interfering in people's genes is intervening a bit too far in human creation.
I admit that the idea of editing the human genome is a bit scary.
The use of gene editing for non-medical reasons reminds me of the Nazis during the Second World War.
Science and technology are controlling our lives.
I believe that future humans will need genome editing to survive.
 I believe we should remain as natural as possible but we should not shy away from furthering medicine and the chance to save lives.
"Mental health can be understood in different ways depending on who we ask. A complete definition of mental health should take into account the following societal problems: poverty, inequality and discrimination."
It is the responsability of the society to address social inequalities related to mental health (for instance poverty - a poorer person might not be able to finance mental health support). The society must include all those aspects when deciding on new policies or programs.
"Being poor, living far away from a city, being victim of racism are examples of factors which can influence a person's inclination to seek for help when having mental health problems."
Improving working or studying conditions does not affects mental health.
Mental health issues require less urgency and resources than physical health conditions.
Die Verbesserung der Arbeits- oder Studienbedingungen hat keine Auswirkungen auf die psychische Gesundheit.
Fragen rund um die psychische Gesundheit sind weniger dringlich und benötigen weniger Ressourcen als körperliche Erkrankungen.
"La salute mentale può essere intesa in modi diversi. Una definizione completa di salute mentale dovrebbe tenere conto di problemi sociali quali povertà, disuguaglianza e discriminazione."
È responsabilità della società affrontare le disuguaglianze sociali legate alla salute mentale (ad esempio la povertà: una persona più povera potrebbe non essere in grado di finanziare il sostegno per la salute mentale). Bisogna considerare tutti questi aspetti quando si decide su nuove politiche o programmi
"Essere poveri, vivere lontano dai centri urbani o essere vittima di razzismo sono esempi di fattori che possono influenzare l'inclinazione di una persona a cercare aiuto per problemi di salute mentale."
Migliorare le condizioni di lavoro o di studio non incide in alcun modo sulla salute mentale delle persone.
I problemi di salute mentale richiedono meno urgenza e risorse rispetto alle condizioni di salute fisica.
Mental health issue are exclusively medical concerns and not a societal problem.
"It is good that basic insurance does not cover mental health assistance fully, since only few people need it."
Individuals should take responsibility for their mental well-being.
I can greatly affect mental health through my personal choices.
"Personal cultural or religious beliefs and preferences should guide the choice of treatment methods, including therapy and medications."
"Personal solutions (e.g. Yoga club membership) are more effective than government intervention in tackling mental health-related problems (e.g., social worker or psychologist in schools)."
"As well as being supported by a mental health professional (a psychologist, for example), I can combat my anxiety by trying to improve my daily life, boost my self-confidence and develop personally."
Jede:r Einzelne ist selbst verantwortlich für sein psychisches Wohlbefinden.
ich kann den Zustand meiner eigenen psychischen Gesundheit  mit meinen persönlichen Entscheidungen stark beeinflussen
"Um psychische Krankheiten zu behandeln, sollten persönliche, kulturelle oder religiöse Überzeugungen keine Rolle spielen bei der Frage, wie die Krankheit behandelt werden soll (Therapie, Medikamente etc.)"
Private Lösungen sind bei der Bewältigung von Problemen im Zusammenhang mit der psychischen Gesundheit wirksamer als staatliche Maßnahmen.
"Ergänzend zu konkreten Behandlungsmethoden hilft es, sich persönlich zu entwickeln und das Selbstvertrauen zu stärken, um eigene Ängste zu bewältigen."
I problemi di salute mentale sono unicamente di natura medica e non un problema sociale.
"È un bene che l'assicurazione di base non copra completamente l'assistenza per la salute mentale, poiché solo poche persone ne hanno bisogno."
Gli individui dovrebbero assumersi la responsabilità del proprio benessere mentale.
Posso influenzare notevolmente la salute mentale attraverso le mie scelte personali.
"Le convinzioni e le preferenze culturali o religiose personali dovrebbero guidare la scelta dei metodi di trattamento, inclusi terapia e farmaci."
Le soluzioni personali (ad esempio l'iscrizione a un club di yoga) sono più efficaci dell'intervento del governo nell'affrontare i problemi legati alla salute mentale (come ad esempio la presenza assistente sociale o psicologo nelle scuole).
"Oltre ad essere supportato da un professionista della salute mentale (uno psicologo, per esempio), posso combattere la mia ansia cercando di migliorare la mia vita quotidiana, aumentare la mia autostima e crescere personalmente."
"Ideally, mental healthcare should be fully recognised and reimbursed through basic insurance."
"More government funding is needed to improve mental health services and access, particularly for marginalized individuls facing socioeconomic disparities."
"Private mental health service is better than the public, so the mental health system in Switzerland should all be private."
"Investing in mental health sevice as school and workplace (e,g. having social workers in the facilities) is crucial to prevent negative mental outcomes."
"It is difficult to address the root causes of mental health issues as it requires significant societal change, not just prevention efforts."
"Investing in prevention strategies, such as early identification, education, and promoting healthy environments, is essential to address mental health."
Die Politik sollte die psychische Gesundheitsversorgung durch eine obligatorische Grundversicherung (LAMAL-KVG) für alle zugänglich und erschwinglich machen.
"Die Politik sollte mehr Gelder einsetzen, um den Zugang zu psychozialen Diensten für alle zu erleichtern.  "
"Die Privatisierung psychosozialer Dienste ist ein guter Ansatz, um den Zugang zu verbessern. "
"Um negative Folgen von psychischen Erkrankungen zu verhindern, sind mehr Investitionen in Schulen, am Arbeitsplatz und in Sportvereinen nötig."
"Es ist schwierig, die Ursachen für psychische Probleme zu bekämpfen, weil dies grosse gesellschaftliche Veränderungen erfordern würde."
"Für eine gute psychische Gesundheit aller ist es wichtig, in die Früherkennung und in die Förderung eines gesunden Umfelds zu investieren."
"Idealmente, la salute mentale dovrebbe essere pienamente riconosciuta e rimborsata attraverso l'assicurazione di base."
"Sono necessari maggiori finanziamenti governativi per migliorare i servizi di salute mentale e il loro accesso, in particolare per le persone emarginate soggette a disparità socioeconomiche."
"Il servizio di salute mentale privato è migliore del pubblico, quindi il sistema di salute mentale in Svizzera dovrebbe essere tutto privato."
Investire nei servizi di salute mentale come la scuola e il posto di lavoro (ad esempio avere assistenti sociali nelle strutture) è fondamentale per prevenire esiti mentali negativi.
"È difficile affrontare le cause profonde dei problemi di salute mentale in quanto richiede un cambiamento sociale significativo, non solo sforzi di prevenzione."
"Investire in strategie di prevenzione, come l'identificazione precoce, l'educazione e la promozione di ambienti sani, è essenziale per affrontare la salute mentale."
"In order to avoid people having mental health issues to feeling alone or isolated, we should speak more about those topics in schools and in the work places in order to increase public understanding and sensibility."
People should take responsibility to actively address their own biases and prejudices towards individuals with mental health disorders.
People with mental health disorders should not be allowed to work with children
"Focusing on prevention strategies (e.g., governmental media campaign) is crucial for reducing the impact of stigma associated with mental health conditions."
"Um die Stigmatisierung der psychischen Gesundheit zu bekämpfen, müssen wir ein soziales Bewusstsein, Bildungsprogramme und Antidiskriminierungsmaßnahmen schaffen."

Menschen mit psychischen Störungen sollten nicht mit gefährdeten Menschen arbeiten dürfen.
"Um die Auswirkungen von psychischen Erkrankungen zu verringern, ist es wichtig, sich auf geeignete Präventionsstrategien zu konzentrieren."
"Per evitare che le persone con problemi di salute mentale si sentano sole o isolate, dovremmo parlare di più di questi argomenti nelle scuole e nei luoghi di lavoro per aumentare la comprensione e la sensibilità del pubblico."
Le persone dovrebbero assumersi la responsabilità di affrontare attivamente i propri pregiudizi e pregiudizi nei confronti delle persone con disturbi di salute mentale.
Le persone con disturbi mentali non dovrebbero essere autorizzate a lavorare con i bambini
"Concentrarsi sulle strategie di prevenzione (ad esempio, campagne mediatiche governative) è fondamentale per ridurre l'impatto dello stigma associato alle condizioni di salute mentale."
"Social media contributes to mental health problems through cyberbullying, social comparison, and the unrealistic portrayal of life."
"Schools should play a crucial role in creating a supportive environment, both online and offline, to mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health."
Underage individuals should be legally (<16) banned from using social media.
Social media platforms should be enforced parental control
"Soziale Medien tragen durch Cybermobbing, soziale Vergleiche und die unrealistische Darstellung des Lebens zu psychischen Problemen bei."
"Die Schule soll eine wichtige Rolle spielen, um die negativen Auswirkungen der sozialen Medien auf die psychische Gesundheit abzumildern."
Die Nutzung von sozialen Medien sollte für minderjährige Personen gesetzlich verboten werden.
"Die Regierung sollte eine strengere Altersüberprüfung und elterliche Kontrolle durchsetzen, um die negativen Auswirkungen der sozialen Medien abzumildern."
"I social media contribuiscono ai problemi di salute mentale attraverso il cyberbullismo, il confronto sociale e la rappresentazione irrealistica della vita."
"Le scuole dovrebbero svolgere un ruolo cruciale nella creazione di un ambiente favorevole, sia online che offline, per mitigare l'impatto negativo dei social media sulla salute mentale."
Alle persone minorenni dovrebbe essere legalmente vietato (<16) l'uso dei social media 
Alle piattaforme di social media dovrebbe essere imposto il controllo parentale
The swiss food system contributes to climate change and pollution
Agriculture is already very ecological. Swiss farmers are on the right track
Intensive food production can go along with the protection of agriculture and health
"As a citizen that pays taxes, the public money should be used in ways that do not harm nature and health"
Actions on the food system in Switzerland are useless as it has no impact on the world
Farmers already suffer enough from strict rules. Swiss agriculture would be threatened by even more stringent regulation
Food accessibility and security is not compatible with a sustainable food system
