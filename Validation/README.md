This is the code to generate DRI statements for a DRI survey on food policy in Switzerland.
Apart from the prompts it runs just like the main code.
In 07_validation.ipynb I prepare the data for the final analysis.
The final analysis is then conducted in the excel-files in data/06_comparison where I manually evalutate the quality of the generated statements by comparing them to the ones generated by Mathys.
